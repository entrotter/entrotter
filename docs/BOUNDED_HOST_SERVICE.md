# Bounded API host service

The Docker worker's limits do not limit its caller. This reference deployment runs
the local API and its Docker client inside a systemd user service in a dedicated
Linux VM. It adds an enforceable host-process budget without changing the engine,
SDK, CLI or v0.1 report format. It remains a proposed, operator-installed local
configuration requiring independent review, not a hosted multi-tenant service.

| Boundary | Limit and proof |
| --- | --- |
| API process and its ordinary children | One CPU quota, 256 MiB, no swap, 64 tasks, 256 file descriptors, no core files |
| Service session | One hour maximum plus up to 15 seconds to stop; no automatic restart |
| Worker | Existing one CPU, 512 MiB, 128 tasks and 180-second independent timer; one worker per daemon |
| Measured dedicated guest | Two vCPUs, 2 GiB configured memory, no swap, one 10 GiB writable block device |
| Reports | Existing separate 128 MiB/128-file API and cooperating CLI export budgets |
| Host shares | Read-only; actual attempted writes failed with EROFS |

`ExecStartPre` runs [the checker](../scripts/check_host_envelope.py) before the API.
It reads the actual cgroup v2 CPU/memory/swap/task controls and process limits,
and rejects absent, unlimited, malformed or excessive settings. Unit options
alone are not accepted as proof. The checker also requires NoNewPrivileges.
The [service](../deploy/entrotter-engine.service) uses a loopback-only engine and
rate-limits journal messages; it has no boot enablement section.

## Dedicated VM prerequisites

The measured environment is Colima 0.8.1, Linux arm64, Python 3.12.3 and systemd
255. [The example profile](../deploy/colima-entrotter.yaml) preserves the ordinary
Docker context and provides an explicit read-only mount instead of sharing the
operator's home directory. Choose a fresh profile and replace its placeholder
with an existing empty directory. Do not overwrite an existing profile's data.

Colima's [versioned configuration implementation](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima/blob/v0.8.1/environment/vm/lima/yaml.go)
is the source for the tested mapping; newer versions can have separate root/data
disks. Inspect the generated Lima configuration, `lsblk -b`, `/proc/meminfo`,
`/proc/swaps` and `findmnt` before relying on a capacity claim. Verify that guest
home, `/tmp` and `/var/lib/docker` use the bounded guest disk and every host share
is read-only. The service checker verifies process limits, not VM configuration.

A working systemd user manager and session bus are required. The test VM initially
lacked the `dbus-user-session` package; installation of Ubuntu's signed package
`1.14.10-4ubuntu4.1` resolved the transient-unit test prerequisite. User-manager
socket recovery was also needed during setup. Those setup failures are not
counted as successful application runs. On a dedicated Ubuntu guest, install
`dbus-user-session` if needed and start its user `dbus.socket`. User lingering may
be required to keep the manually started service running after SSH exits.

## Install inside the guest

Use an inspected coordination checkout containing this PR's files in the guest or
on its read-only share. Record its commit and the source hashes. The commands below
create a fresh application directory; they do not replace an existing installation.
The engine commit is the tested proposed revision, still awaiting independent
approval. A local Docker daemon, Git and Python are prerequisites.

```bash
set -eu
coordination_checkout=/path/to/this/entrotter/checkout
app_dir="$HOME/.local/share/entrotter"
config_dir="$HOME/.config/entrotter"
test ! -e "$app_dir"
test ! -e "$config_dir"
test ! -e "$HOME/.config/systemd/user/entrotter-engine.service"
mkdir -p "$app_dir" "$config_dir" "$HOME/.config/systemd/user"
chmod 700 "$app_dir" "$config_dir"
git clone https://github.com/entrotter/engine.git "$app_dir/engine"
git -C "$app_dir/engine" checkout --detach 2c843842dc57387150e3bb080c720bc94ce18bc5
export PYTHONPATH="$app_dir/engine/src"
export ENTROTTER_DOCKER_SOCKET=/var/run/docker.sock
python3 "$app_dir/engine/scripts/build_worker.py" --output "$app_dir/worker-image.json"
image_id=$(python3 -c 'import json,sys; print(json.load(open(sys.argv[1]))["image_id"])' "$app_dir/worker-image.json")
printf 'PYTHONPATH=%s\nENTROTTER_DOCKER_SOCKET=/var/run/docker.sock\nENTROTTER_WORKER_IMAGE=%s\n' \
  "$app_dir/engine/src" "$image_id" > "$config_dir/engine.env"
chmod 600 "$config_dir/engine.env"
cp "$coordination_checkout/scripts/check_host_envelope.py" "$app_dir/check_host_envelope.py"
cp "$coordination_checkout/deploy/entrotter-engine.service" "$HOME/.config/systemd/user/"
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user start entrotter-engine.service
systemctl --user show entrotter-engine.service -p ActiveState -p ControlGroup -p MemoryMax -p TasksMax -p RuntimeMaxUSec
```

The API remains on `127.0.0.1:8787`. Keep it local. Check the service journal if
startup fails; never delete `ExecStartPre` or loosen quotas to obtain a green run.
Stop with `systemctl --user stop entrotter-engine.service`, then stop the VM when
finished. An hour-long session ends even if the user has left it unattended.

## Reproduce the enforcement checks

[The explicit Linux test](../tests_host/check_service.py) is separate from unit
policy tests. In the guest application directory it expects `engine`, `sdk` and
`cli` source trees, the checker, `fixture.json` (liquidity-shock) and `local.json`
(engine's local test input). The measured SDK/CLI pins are respectively
`b0c2ba3bba411e548af44101ae06e879bd7b5dc0` and
`a63a39000e03d151e80b5a9c47dd4df449281b93`. Copy the test beside the checker, then:

```bash
python3 "$HOME/.local/share/entrotter/check_service.py" --output /tmp/host-proof.json
```

Use a dedicated test VM: the test intentionally exercises bounded allocation,
fork admission and timeouts in uniquely named transient units. It executes actual
CLI→SDK→API fixture/Anvil runs, checks full stored/exported equality and hashes,
then verifies CPU throttling, EAGAIN at the task ceiling, OOM-kill, a two-second
scaled timeout, and refusal to start a main executable with unlimited memory.
Transient units are stopped/reset afterward. This is not a simulated resource test.

The [measured evidence](../evidence/host-service/summary.json) includes kernel
controls, full test results, source hashes, VM topology and read-only write probes.
The fixture and local-EVM artifact IDs match the earlier integration records.
The one-hour production expiry was read back, not waited out; the timer fault test
uses two seconds. Live root-disk exhaustion was not attempted: disk evidence is
actual block-device size, writable mount topology and rejection of host-share
writes. The existing report-quota tests cover application-level exhaustion.

## Boundaries that remain

Only processes run in this service receive its cgroup budget. Direct macOS/Python
callers, developer native opt-outs and independently started CLI processes do not
inherit it. Guest CLI clients remain inside the VM's aggregate resource boundary.
Docker daemon/build work is outside the service cgroup but inside the measured VM;
the worker has its own limits. Operator-selected images and Docker socket access
remain trusted, not an arbitrary-code sandbox or an archive-host egress firewall.

The 10 GiB claim covers the guest writable block device. Host hypervisor overhead,
Colima diagnostic logs, cached base-image downloads, backups and manually exported
files are outside that disk claim. VM capacity does not impose a hard whole-build
deadline, and abrupt host death can leave charged staging files. A service kill can
leave a worker until its independent timer and removal complete. These limits,
independent review/merge, and other release gates remain explicit.
