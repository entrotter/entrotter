**A time machine for onchain agents.**

Rewind a state. Change a decision. Inspect the evidence.

Entrotter is local-first, MIT-licensed simulation software, not a trading website
or a price predictor. The intended users are teams evaluating onchain agents
before giving them production permissions.

## Current release: experimental 0.1.0

This workspace contains a working offline stress-test engine, a loopback-only
API, a Python SDK, a CLI, and a static report/documentation site. It also includes
an Anvil adapter for paired local or archived-state EVM execution. Genuine Anvil
and archive-RPC validation is a separate gate: do not infer it from offline tests.
See `STATUS.md` and `evidence/` for exactly what has and has not run.

All six repositories are public at the links below. The documentation site is
live at https://entrotter.github.io/. Packages remain unpublished and the engine
runs locally. See STATUS.md for current verification and open acceptance gates.

is the contract between them. Do not split further until there is an independent
contribution boundary that justifies another repository.

## Quick start: reproduce the tested candidate locally

Follow the [pinned quick start](docs/QUICK_START.md) to fetch compatible public
source revisions, build the Docker worker and produce a verified offline report.
You need Python 3.11+, Git and a running local Linux Docker daemon with cgroup v2.
Setup downloads public build inputs; running the fixture afterward needs no
network, wallet or paid API key. There are no third-party Python runtime packages.

The guide selects tested candidate commits that still await independent review
and integration. Cloning all repositories at `main` currently selects an older
native runtime; it does not reproduce the candidate's bounded default.

For normal editable package installation, run `bash entrotter/scripts/bootstrap.sh`.
Do not install these names from a public package registry: they are not published.
The bootstrap installs the sibling source checkouts with `--no-deps` to avoid
accidentally resolving an unrelated package with the same name. Run it only after
the pinned checkout steps; it does not select candidate revisions, install Docker
or build/configure the worker. Build-time package tooling may require network access.

The proposed [signed-prefix reader integration](evidence/trace-reader-integration/README.md)
adds typed offline SDK inspection and a separate local browser view of original
transactions, receipt differences and nonce conflicts. Its exact component and
combined CI evidence is distinct from the older deployed site. Follow the
[optional replay instructions](docs/QUICK_START.md#optional-original-transaction-prefix-replay)
for the recorded four-transaction case and archive requirements.

The [same-block funding composition](evidence/trace-funding-integration/README.md)
adds a trace-only admission fix and cross-repository inspection of the synthetic
original-signature baseline and adverse funding omission. Historical and bounded
execution, combined CI and protected publication remain distinct evidence gates.

The proposed [bounded historical price composition](evidence/bounded-observed-integration/README.md)
lets the fixed Aave/WETH observation command use the default Docker worker.
[Replay and inspect the result](docs/QUICK_START.md#replay-historical-prices-through-the-bounded-worker)
with the SDK, CLI or local viewer. The recorded32-input run verified every original
baseline receipt and four complete price views; missing state and worker deadlines
remain explicit. Read-only price dependence does not establish a signed consumer
strategy or profit. Candidate integration and protected publication remain separate.

The proposed [Aave account composition](evidence/account-impact-integration/README.md)
adds exact collateral, debt, borrowing-capacity and health-factor inspection beside
the recorded price and receipt evidence. Its [offline commands and replay guide](docs/QUICK_START.md#compare-historical-aave-account-impact)
use the same bounded worker and disclose unproven views. This is read-only account
state comparison; signed strategy execution and financial return remain unproven.
The [account viewer composition](evidence/viewer-position-integration/README.md)
adds exact SDK-to-browser inspection of the same sealed records, including explicit
synthetic missing/large-integer/no-debt/boundary controls. The next
[account summary composition](evidence/account-summary-integration/README.md)
selects the independently verified mobile summary: exact borrowing-capacity and
health-factor changes before the full table, with positive/negative/zero and
unavailable/no-debt behavior. Original report facts and all nine reader bodies
remain unchanged. The current viewer also identifies local v0.1 imports explicitly,
clears previous results while loading, and lets the same example be selected after
a rejected file. [Source-label verification](https://github.com/entrotter/entrotter.github.io/blob/422d98a7cf753bfc9be9b86553cd76f3a549f70c/evidence/report-source/README.md) preserves the actual regression and full browser evidence.

Terminal users can also inspect the same account record with
`position-inspect --format text`: all six exact account fields and differences,
health status, source IDs and unproven reasons appear without manual unit scaling.
The default JSON remains unchanged; [CLI evidence](https://github.com/entrotter/cli/blob/1ce7677d809847bc9f5917f2ca633878b1761c3c/evidence/position-text/README.md)
separates current offline controls and installed-package proof from the original
historical execution. Protected integration and live publication remain separate.

Scripts can use `position-verify --require-complete` or
`observed-verify --require-complete` to require both complete recorded views and
matching baseline receipts. An unproven comparison returns3 with the same JSON
and reasons on stderr; ordinary verification retains its prior exit behavior.
Negative differences and valid no-debt states can pass: completeness does not
prove profit or authenticate a provider. [CLI exit-contract evidence](https://github.com/entrotter/cli/blob/1ce7677d809847bc9f5917f2ca633878b1761c3c/evidence/require-complete/README.md)
records the offline and installed-package checks.

## Local API and SDK

After completing the quick start, keep its environment variables in both terminals.
For additional Linux API-process limits, use the optional
[bounded host service](docs/BOUNDED_HOST_SERVICE.md).

```bash
# Keep this port local. Optionally set ENTROTTER_API_TOKEN on both client and server.
python3 -m entrotter_engine serve --port 8787 --output artifacts
# In another terminal with the same PYTHONPATH:
python3 -m entrotter_cli run scenarios/fixtures/recovery-trap.json -o report.json
```

```python
import json
from entrotter_sdk import Client
scenario = json.load(open("scenarios/fixtures/liquidity-shock.json"))
result = Client().run(scenario)
print(result.artifact_id, result.report["comparison"])
```

## Three distinct execution modes

- `fixture`: deterministic synthetic price-path model. Runs entirely offline.
  Includes causally evaluated hold/circuit-breaker policies, fees, slippage,
  returns and maximum drawdown. Not historical market evidence.
- `evm-local`: real transactions in two private Anvil processes. Uses fake local
  funding, explicit transaction slots, target allowlists and receipt collection.
  The quick-start worker includes pinned Foundry. No host Foundry installation,
  mainnet RPC or wallet key is needed for this mode.
- `evm-fork`: clones an explicit historical block via the operator-supplied
  `ENTROTTER_RPC_URL`, checks its source chain/hash and runs supplied actions on
  local Anvil. Requires archive state. Does not replay later canonical blocks,
  future prices, MEV, counterparties or agent responses.

```bash
python3 -m entrotter_cli run scenarios/evm/local-branch-revert.json --local -o local-evm.json
# Set ENTROTTER_RPC_URL privately before running the next command.
python3 -m entrotter_cli run scenarios/evm/ethereum-state-fork.json --local -o historical-fork.json
```

EVM native/token balance changes are not PnL. Explicitly listed ERC-20 tokens
are tracked with verified decimals and exact raw-unit deltas. Every report contains its scenario, overrides, trace, assumptions and
SHA-256 digest. The digest detects content changes; it does not prove a simulator
or its economic assumptions are correct.

## Publish the OSS repositories and documentation

Inspect `scripts/publish.py`, then use an authenticated GitHub CLI account with
permission to create public repositories in the existing `entrotter` organization.
No custom domain is configured and no CNAME file is included.

```bash
python3 entrotter/scripts/publish.py          # dry run only
python3 entrotter/scripts/publish.py --apply  # creates public repos, pushes, enables Pages
```

The intended Pages address is `https://entrotter.github.io/`. The script prints
actual results; verify the Actions run and HTTP response before calling it live.
It refuses to replace a non-empty existing remote from a fresh local folder,
never changes a private repository to public, and never force-pushes.

Pages only serves the OSS project docs and public, synthetic example reports.
It does not run the engine, receive private report uploads, connect wallets,
process payments, or provide a commercial SaaS. No hosting spend is necessary
for the local software. Paid hosted compute is a later, separately approved task.

## Work toward the competition goal

Read `CODEX_GOAL.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `STATUS.md` and `backlog/`. The goal is an
excellent, independently reproducible submission, not a claim that winning
can be guaranteed. Store measured evidence, real feedback and remaining risks.
Do not stop after building a landing page. Do not mark blockers as completed.

## Actual archived-state evidence

The [Uniswap scenario](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/entrotter/scenarios/8785bb090c13390b783fe8c42f01b26f1d5e7c24/evm/ethereum-uniswap-slippage.json)
compares a successful 1 WETH swap with a reverted minimum-output intervention on
identical Ethereum block 19,000,000 state. Two runs yielded identical artifacts;
see `evidence/historical-verification.json` for timings and resource scope.

```bash
# Public endpoint used during verification; archive availability can change.
export ENTROTTER_RPC_URL=https://eth.drpc.org
PYTHONPATH=engine/src python3 entrotter/scripts/check_historical.py
```

Foundry v1.8.3 is required. On macOS, if Python lacks a certificate bundle, set
`SSL_CERT_FILE=/etc/ssl/cert.pem` to use the trusted OS bundle. Never disable TLS.
This is supplied-action execution on archived state, not historical trace replay,
a reconstructed alternative market, or an integrated-agent benchmark.

## Recorded model decisions

The proposed [recorded-agent viewer](https://github.com/entrotter/entrotter.github.io/pull/14)
lets contributors open the v0.1 report explorer and select **Local EVM · recorded
model decisions**. It places preflight, gas budget, execute/hold and reasons beside
candidate receipts while preserving original model/cost uncertainty. The current
[pinned quick start](docs/QUICK_START.md) selects that tested candidate; independent
approval and live publication remain pending. Original media and model evaluation
inputs retain their separate versions.


The experimental local controller now connects typed `execute`/`hold` model
responses to real Anvil execution and replays a full recording without another
model call. In the artificial transfer/revert example, the model and a simple
preflight rule made identical decisions; the rule was faster. See
[agent evaluation](docs/AGENT_EVALUATION.md) for receipts, measured timings,
metadata, exact replay commands and pending historical/holdout work. The engine
and schema PRs require independent review before this becomes a main-branch release.

The [pinned quick start](docs/QUICK_START.md#4-run-agent-decisions-and-replay-the-recorded-model)
now includes proposed standalone CLI risk execution and complete recorded-model
replay. These commands reuse original decisions and make no new model call;
independent review and main integration remain pending.

The [frozen historical comparison](docs/HISTORICAL_AGENT_EVALUATION.md) now includes
three sourced cases and two previously unused implementation holdouts. All ten
risk/model recordings replayed exactly on fresh forks. The model matched the
preflight rule and took longer in every case; evidence retains that adverse result.

The [direct Anvil comparison](docs/DIRECT_ANVIL_COMPARISON.md) independently
reproduced the same receipts and state in six runs. Median runtimes were similar;
Entrotter's additional value is its reusable scenario, recording and artifact
workflow, which still needs genuine user validation.

The [local worker security evidence](docs/WORKER_SECURITY.md) records real kernel
resource-limit and process-lifecycle checks for the proposed opt-in Docker path.
This remains under review; native defaults and aggregate storage/concurrency
limits are open gates.

The [host resource bounds](docs/HOST_RESOURCE_LIMITS.md) add proposed API report
quotas, connection limits and safe CLI exports, with real CLI/SDK/API fault and
recovery evidence. These PRs remain subject to independent review.

[Documentation link checks](docs/LINK_CHECKS.md) describe the shared CI policy,
local reproduction, full result artifacts and the limits of static link scanning.

[SDK and CLI quality evidence](docs/SDK_CLI_QUALITY.md) records independent source,
dependency, packaging and real API checks, including the local SDK provenance.

[Report viewer accessibility evidence](docs/WEBSITE_ACCESSIBILITY.md) records
keyboard/reflow regressions, exact chart alternatives and actual Linux browser
CI. These proposed changes still await review and deployment.

[Bounded default execution](docs/BOUNDED_DEFAULT.md) records the proposed change
from opt-in workers to normal CLI/API execution with kernel limits. Its separate
source pins and migration instructions require a local Docker daemon. The quick
start uses this candidate; frozen native benchmarks retain their original pins.

[Shared daemon worker admission](docs/DAEMON_WORKER_ADMISSION.md) records the
proposed one-worker default across independent CLI/API processes, ownership-safe
cleanup, real contention tests and explicit recovery limits.

[Shared CLI export retention](docs/SHARED_EXPORT_BUDGET.md) records proposed
cross-process saved/pending report limits, crash recovery and operator inspection.

[Coordination quality](docs/COORDINATION_QUALITY.md) records complete tooling scans,
optimized-Python verification, locked dependencies and frozen-source exceptions.

[Offline schema contracts](docs/SCENARIO_CONTRACTS.md) records local reference
resolution, mandatory checks, frozen input compatibility and scenario quality CI.

[Website quality](docs/WEBSITE_QUALITY.md) records numeric input regressions,
complete source checks, retained findings and actual browser/CI evidence.

The proposed [bounded agent integration](docs/BOUNDED_AGENT_REPLAY.md) reproduces
all 19 existing EVM reports under the worker quotas, including 12 agent-recording
replays without model calls. This is verified on an open branch; independent
approval and dependency-pin integration remain pending.

[Current account-impact demo](submission/media/entrotter-demo-account.mp4) shows exact account changes, receipt evidence and altered-file rejection in 2:36.80; its [source-bound recording evidence](evidence/submission-account-demo/README.md) distinguishes new local execution from recorded historical inspection. Original approved media remains unchanged.

[Submission review package](submission/README.md) includes recorded pitch/demo
videos, measured evidence, explicit AI/prior-work disclosure and unvalidated
market/evaluation plans. Owner review and genuine demand validation remain open.

[Fresh bounded agent reproduction](docs/BOUNDED_AGENT_INTEGRATION.md) combines
immutable public checkouts, a new venv and worker build, exact recorded-agent replay
and standalone CLI verification. Docker/VM setup is a measured-scope prerequisite.

[Required CI checks](docs/REQUIRED_CHECKS.md) records the enforced main-branch
policy, successful source checkpoints and migration of older partial PRs.

[Bounded API host service](docs/BOUNDED_HOST_SERVICE.md) adds a verified Linux
service envelope and dedicated-VM operating profile, with measured scope limits.

[Bounded Linux CLI](docs/BOUNDED_CLI.md) adds an optional per-user caller budget,
atomic admission and owner-death cleanup, with actual production-timer evidence.
