# Entrotter submission index

**Saved project draft, not a submitted entry.** The owner approved the existing
videos and supplied the solo-participant facts on 2026-09-20. User evaluation is
deferred, with zero completed sessions. The authenticated event account now has
an [Entrotter draft](https://colosseum.com/arena/projects/entrotter); product details
are saved. Final submission opens October 6 at 11:00 UTC / 20:00 JST. Formal
post-submission editing is not yet verified, so the owner's conditional submission
authorization has not been exercised. No outreach or final entry was sent.

## Product

**Entrotter — a local test bench for onchain agent decisions.** Start from a known
blockchain state, change one decision, and retain an experiment another developer
can inspect and reproduce. The initial audience hypothesis is small EVM agent
teams already maintaining their own simulation scripts.

The engine runs paired local Anvil branches or forks pinned historical state.
Versioned reports record assumptions, source pins, overrides, receipts, native and
ERC-20 units, constrained agent observations/actions and replay records. A static
viewer imports reports locally in the browser. No signing key or mainnet write is
required. Archived-state action execution is not historical transaction replay,
a prediction of future markets, or a measurement of profit.

## Submission materials

| Material | Artifact | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Product demo | [MP4](media/entrotter-demo.mp4), [VTT](media/entrotter-demo.vtt), [SRT](media/entrotter-demo.srt) · 2:54.24 | Recorded actual Chromium interactions and bounded engine calls; owner approved |
| Product pitch | [Short MP4](media/entrotter-pitch-short.mp4), [VTT](media/entrotter-pitch-short.vtt) · 1:46.07 | New six-card pitch with confirmed solo-founder context; synthetic narration. The original 2:51.44 review cut is retained but exceeds the current form limit |
| Video production evidence | [Manifest](../evidence/submission-media/manifest.json) | Source pins, exact scripts/timelines, output hashes, execution and rendering checks |
| Pitch text and shot list | [Video scripts](VIDEO_SCRIPTS.md) | Exact narration, including hypotheses and limitations |
| Market/pricing/distribution | [Market hypotheses](MARKET.md) | Unvalidated, no fabricated TAM/customer/revenue claim |
| Target-user evaluation | [Evaluation protocol](EVALUATIONS.md) | Deferred by owner; zero completed records, no demand claim |
| Development/AI disclosure | [Disclosure](DISCLOSURE.md) | Supplied archive and substantial Codex assistance disclosed; owner reports event-period AI generation; original archive digest unavailable |
| Rules, deadline and eligibility | [Competition requirements](../docs/COMPETITION.md) | Public requirements rechecked; authenticated event draft verified; owner confirms eligibility |

The original recordings label synthetic narration and their historical review
status; the owner has since approved them. The short pitch retains explicit
synthetic-narration disclosure and does not impersonate the founder. The
demo uses actual product UI, a clearly labelled recording console displaying real
process output, and generated report files. It does not stage successful output,
claim to be the founder speaking, or present the recording console as a product
feature. The pitch does not establish founder communication skills or market fit. No video platform has received an upload.

## Evidence and differentiation

[Bounded reproduction](../docs/BOUNDED_AGENT_REPLAY.md) matched all 19 original
complete EVM reports, including 12 agent recordings, with no new agent-model call.
The new demo performs an additional real local risk run and frozen-model replay.
This proves a reproducible observation/action contract, not a better model.
[Fresh public bounded replay](../docs/BOUNDED_AGENT_INTEGRATION.md) now provides
a single measured checkout/build/replay/CLI-verification command, with Docker
setup prerequisites and exact current proposed pins.
[Historical evaluation](../docs/HISTORICAL_AGENT_EVALUATION.md) includes three
sourced cases plus two pre-frozen holdouts; those holdouts are now consumed. The
model matched the risk rule and was slower in every evaluated case.

[Direct Anvil comparison](../docs/DIRECT_ANVIL_COMPARISON.md) produced identical
common outcomes in six runs, with medians of 8.653 seconds for the bespoke script
and 8.689 for Entrotter. No speed or developer-productivity advantage is proven.
The proposed difference is reusable scenario validation, recorded causal decisions,
exact replay and a shareable report/inspection workflow. A few Anvil scripts may
be the right solution for a single bespoke experiment. Actual willingness to adopt
or pay for the broader workflow is still a hypothesis.

## Owner decisions and remaining submission requirements

- Doraking is the sole member; eligibility confirmed and no funding reported.
- The owner reports no Entrotter development before September 14, 2026, and
  event-period AI generation of the initial code and purple mascot.
- Education and previous employment are not disclosed. The mandatory current
  school-status field only offers Yes/No, so it remains unanswered.
- Existing videos are approved. The form requires a pitch of at most two minutes
  and a demo of at most three minutes, hosted on YouTube, Loom or Vimeo. The new
  short pitch passes a full decode/duration check; hosting is still pending.
- Logo upload was rejected by the browser file-upload transport; no logo was
  uploaded. The saved project still needs its logo and two supported video URLs.
- User evaluations are deferred and are not a current owner-required gate.
- Independent GitHub approval and protected main/Pages integration remain open.
- Formal submission is authorized only if later editing is verified. The form
  currently confirms editable drafts before opening, not editing after submission.

The material is not a claim of a win, market validation or complete goal acceptance.
