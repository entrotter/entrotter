# Entrotter submission index

**Saved project draft, not a submitted entry.** The owner approved the existing
videos and supplied the solo-participant facts on 2026-09-20. User evaluation is
deferred, with zero completed sessions. The authenticated event account now has
an [Entrotter draft](https://colosseum.com/arena/projects/entrotter); product details
are saved. Final submission opens October 6 at 11:00 UTC / 20:00 JST. Formal
post-submission editing is not yet verified. The owner now authorizes formal
submission once quality conditions and required personal facts are verified and
the portal is open, without another blanket approval. No outreach or final entry
was sent. Independent review, authentication and terms must still be respected.

## Product

**Entrotter — a local test bench for onchain agent decisions.** Start from a known
blockchain state, change one decision, and retain an experiment another developer
can inspect and reproduce. The initial audience hypothesis is small EVM agent
teams already maintaining their own simulation scripts.

The engine runs paired local Anvil branches or forks pinned historical state.
Versioned reports record assumptions, source pins, overrides, receipts, native and
ERC-20 units, constrained agent observations/actions and replay records. A static
viewer imports reports locally in the browser. No signing key or mainnet write is
required. Archived-state action execution is not historical transaction replay,
a prediction of future markets, or a measurement of profit.

## Submission materials

| Material | Artifact | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Updated account-impact demo | [MP4](media/entrotter-demo-account.mp4), [VTT](media/entrotter-demo-account.vtt), [SRT](media/entrotter-demo-account.srt) · 2:36.80 | Additional current-viewer cut: two fresh bounded local calls, recorded account 13/card/receipt inspection, lossless bad-ID rejection and recovery; original owner-approved cut retained |
| Product demo | [MP4](media/entrotter-demo.mp4), [VTT](media/entrotter-demo.vtt), [SRT](media/entrotter-demo.srt) · 2:54.24 | Recorded actual Chromium interactions and bounded engine calls; owner approved |
| Product pitch | [Short MP4](media/entrotter-pitch-short.mp4), [VTT](media/entrotter-pitch-short.vtt) · 1:46.07 | New six-card pitch with confirmed solo-founder context; synthetic narration. The original 2:51.44 review cut is retained but exceeds the current form limit |
| Video production evidence | [Manifest](../evidence/submission-media/manifest.json) | Source pins, exact scripts/timelines, output hashes, execution and rendering checks |
| Pitch text and shot list | [Video scripts](VIDEO_SCRIPTS.md) | Exact narration, including hypotheses and limitations |
| Market/pricing/distribution | [Market hypotheses](MARKET.md) | Unvalidated, no fabricated TAM/customer/revenue claim |
| Target-user evaluation | [Evaluation protocol](EVALUATIONS.md) | Deferred by owner; zero completed records, no demand claim |
| Development/AI disclosure | [Disclosure](DISCLOSURE.md) | Supplied archive and substantial Codex assistance disclosed; owner reports event-period AI generation; original archive digest unavailable |
| Rules, deadline and eligibility | [Competition requirements](../docs/COMPETITION.md) | Public requirements rechecked; authenticated event draft verified; owner confirms eligibility |

The [new account-impact recording evidence](../evidence/submission-account-demo/README.md) binds viewer 8aa0/Engine 88c6 and the exact generated local report. This new cut is additional material; human auditory review and supported-host delivery remain pending. The [15 current narration cues](../evidence/submission-account-demo/timeline.json) preserve the exact new script.

The original recordings label synthetic narration and their historical review
status; the owner has since approved them. The short pitch retains explicit
synthetic-narration disclosure and does not impersonate the founder. The
demo uses actual product UI, a clearly labelled recording console displaying real
process output, and generated report files. It does not stage successful output,
claim to be the founder speaking, or present the recording console as a product
feature. The pitch does not establish founder communication skills or market fit. No video platform has received an upload.

## Latest candidate sources

The [parent-read cache composition](../evidence/trace-parent-cache-integration/README.md)
selects engine198139f/PR34, retaining safe private RPC diagnostics. All8 component
checks and independent complete raw-artifact review pass. Actual native005 keeps
the same original32 signed inputs, skip12 and150-second shared budget; both
branches complete and all32 baseline receipt projections equal originals.
The producer feed update occurs only in baseline. This is a32-of181 producer
prefix, not dependent-consumer/profit/full-block/provider-authenticity or historical
speed evidence. Previous failures remain preserved. The404e8db/198 composition passed all5 combined checks and full artifact review;
recordings keep their original source versions. The current
[receipt comparison composition](../evidence/trace-comparison-integration/README.md)
adopts viewerb1cfb00 with all4 component checks and independent Linux artifact
review. Four offline reader steps pass, including the unchanged native00532-input
report. Candidate receipt grouping preserves exact field differences and shows
12 matches/1 omission/19 position-cumulative-gas-only/0 execution-field changes.
Receipt matches do not establish unchanged contract state, consumer behavior or
profit. New combined CI and protected-main/Pages approval remain separate.

These are the October 2 candidate sources, still awaiting independent approval
and protected integration. Follow the [current pinned quick start](../docs/QUICK_START.md)
instead of rebuilding from moving main branches. The recordings below retain
their original source versions.

The execution snapshot below contains the optional bounded Linux CLI launcher,
the canonical contract identity fix and original signed transaction-prefix replay.
The [prior four-prefix receipt evidence](../evidence/canonical-mine-integration/summary.json)
binds its original engine817/schema sources, receipt match and exact inputs.
The prefix is a separate technical case. The new
[funding composition](../evidence/trace-funding-integration/README.md) verifies
native synthetic same-block funding and an adverse omission without state repair.
The [oracle/provider composition](../evidence/trace-oracle-integration/README.md)
adds native signed update/consumer causal proof and actual read-only fault/control
coverage, including an integrity-valid unverified storage-failure report. Archived
funding/dependent oracle-consumer, provider authenticity and full-block/end-state remain open. The
[recorded-agent viewer evidence](../evidence/agent-viewer-integration/summary.json)
adds original decision/provenance inspection and preserves original reports. Prior combined checks and reproduction measurements retain their source pins;
current candidate verification is recorded in
[candidate PR55](https://github.com/entrotter/entrotter/pull/55). Prior walkthroughs
retain their actual older pins. Guide and evidence updates occur in later
documentation commits with the same production tools; this snapshot is proposed
code, not an independently approved release.

The [signed-prefix reader composition](../evidence/trace-reader-integration/README.md)
adds SDK and browser inspection of the actual four-receipt case. SDK all5checks
and viewer all4checks pass; root artifact verification confirms33Linux browser
groups/25raw axe scans without reported violations. Checksums and internal
relationships do not authenticate source state or prove economic/EVM truth.
The previous8029/a253 funding composition passed all five combined checks and55
document hashes, with complete API/CLI/export and both offline reader proofs. The
new oracle/provider composition requires its own exact-head CI. No new
video/model/holdout result is implied.

The earlier diagnostic successor [engineaac525c](https://github.com/entrotter/engine/tree/aac525c8279005a3a8468fe3928e691c3ce80148)
has seven successful checks but a failed four-prefix candidate gate: all original
receipts match, while one changed-branch transaction lacks a receipt. A later
diagnostic succeeds and does not establish the first failure's cause. The
[partial proof](../evidence/trace-oracle-integration/diagnostic-ci-partial.json)
keeps those outcomes separate. The prior selected engine99fd passes all eight checks
on its first attempt, including normal default1/4 and image/native advisory gates.
[Independent full proof](../evidence/trace-oracle-integration/root-engine-full-CI.json)
binds those raw reports and audits. Its conditional observation diagnostic was
skipped, so the original failure cause remains unknown. These99fd/e46 and older
8029/a253/935 records are historical. The table now selects530ebc2/65c, with new
combined CI pending. The previously tested public158fbc0/99fd composition passes
all five checks and complete artifact review; see the latest evidence above.

## Evidence and differentiation

[Bounded reproduction](../docs/BOUNDED_AGENT_REPLAY.md) matched all 19 original
complete EVM reports, including 12 agent recordings, with no new agent-model call.
The new demo performs an additional real local risk run and frozen-model replay.
This proves a reproducible observation/action contract, not a better model.
[Fresh public bounded replay](../docs/BOUNDED_AGENT_INTEGRATION.md) now provides
a single measured checkout/build/replay/CLI-verification command, with Docker
setup prerequisites and exact current proposed pins.
[Historical evaluation](../docs/HISTORICAL_AGENT_EVALUATION.md) includes three
sourced cases plus two pre-frozen holdouts; those holdouts are now consumed. The
model matched the risk rule and was slower in every evaluated case.

[Direct Anvil comparison](../docs/DIRECT_ANVIL_COMPARISON.md) produced identical
common outcomes in six runs, with medians of 8.653 seconds for the bespoke script
and 8.689 for Entrotter. No speed or developer-productivity advantage is proven.
The proposed difference is reusable scenario validation, recorded causal decisions,
exact replay and a shareable report/inspection workflow. A few Anvil scripts may
be the right solution for a single bespoke experiment. Actual willingness to adopt
or pay for the broader workflow is still a hypothesis.

## Owner decisions and remaining submission requirements

- Doraking is the sole member; eligibility confirmed and no funding reported.
- The owner reports no Entrotter development before September 14, 2026, and
  event-period AI generation of the initial code and purple mascot.
- Education and previous employment are not disclosed. The mandatory current
  school-status field only offers Yes/No, so it remains unanswered.
- Existing videos are approved. The form requires a pitch of at most two minutes
  and a demo of at most three minutes, hosted on YouTube, Loom or Vimeo. The new
  short pitch passes a full decode/duration check; hosting is still pending.
- The October 1 authenticated draft shows the uploaded project logo
  `icon_trasparent_v2.png` (139 KB). Two supported video URLs are still missing.
  This supersedes the September 20 failed upload attempt.
- The saved required city needs owner verification; do not infer personal facts.
- User evaluations are deferred and are not a current owner-required gate.
- Independent GitHub approval and protected main/Pages integration remain open.
- Formal submission is authorized when the quality conditions and required facts
  are verified and the portal is open. The form confirms editable drafts before
  opening; post-submission editing remains unverified.

See the [October 1 authenticated draft readback](../evidence/submission-preparation/oct01-checkpoint.json)
and [original preparation evidence](../evidence/submission-preparation/summary.json).

The material is not a claim of a win, market validation or complete goal acceptance.


The historical [Aave price observation composition](../evidence/consumer-price-integration/README.md)
selected enginebd5527f and retained all other pins and recordings. Its actual
native006 original32/skip12 replay verifies full projected baseline receipts and
4 owned consumer view phases: baseline257082415000→256292441874, candidate
keeps257082415000. All8 component checks/complete raw artifacts and all5 local
SDK/Node22 reader steps pass. Subsequent9b49fe2 combined CI passed all5 original
mandatory checks and full raw review; that verified composition is historical.
Protected-main approval and live candidate Pages remain separate gates. These read-only observations
are distinct from signed consumer transactions, strategy/profit, full-block/root
or provider authenticity. Standard trace-run has no extra-view option at this
selected head; supported CLI work is separate. No new submission is claimed.


The [direct price-wrapper composition](../evidence/direct-observed-wrapper-integration/README.md)
selects engine40bea57/PR35 and viewera19d3b1/PR16. The engine's all8 and viewer's
all4 original mandatory checks and full raw independent reviews pass. The viewer
now accepts the original sealed wrapper directly, displaying four price phases
beside all32 receipt comparisons. The sixth mandatory integration case compares
its complete nested report, classification and raw price/address/unit/head/code
records with the engine validator; all6 exact local scripts pass, and prior5
complete outcomes remain unchanged except the viewer pin.

The prior coordinator213 composition passed all5 original checks and full raw
review. Its subsequent direct-wrapper composition d90f4a9 also passed all5
original checks and full independent raw review (workspace37049503304,
quality37049503150, docs37049503339). These are historical verified compositions;
the current SDKeb candidate's combined CI is recorded separately below. The
coordination execution snapshot row retains older verified source. Protected-main
human approval and Pages remain separate. Videos/model/holdouts and the
application draft are unchanged; no formal submission is claimed. Read-only prices establish no signed consumer
strategy, profit, provider authenticity or full-block/root/opcode result.


The [standalone SDK wrapper composition](../evidence/sdk-observed-integration/README.md)
selects SDKeb9921f, whose all5 original mandatory checks and complete raw review
pass. Python developers can inspect the supported original wrapper directly,
without importing the engine or creating an intermediate trace export. The sixth
mandatory reader compares the complete SDK snapshot, typed classification and
four full typed price/feed/address/unit/head/code/error records with engine40 and
viewera19. Its subsequent coordinator4b037fe passed all5 original required
checks and full independent raw review (workspace37096639467,
quality37096639463, docs37096639482; reviewSHA3d13d25613e0b6cee85ea8e305f65b78ccd7a79ded03b4fc708d8aa3cf7632ea).
That historical verified source selects CLI22; the newer CLI composition below
has a separate current-head CI gate. Human protected-main approval remains separate. Frozen recordings, model/holdouts and
submission draft remain unchanged; no new chain/model/browser or submission claim.


The [terminal price-wrapper composition](../evidence/cli-observed-integration/README.md)
selects CLI1ee3d3a, whose all6 original required checks and full raw independent
review pass. Developers can run observed-verify/observed-inspect without custom
Python or engine conversion. The sixth exact workflow reader runs both commands
and compares complete JSON classification, trace IDs/count and all four typed
records with the reviewed SDK/engine/viewer facts. First5 exact scripts and full
outcomes stay unchanged except the selected CLI pin. New combined candidate CI,
protected-main approval and Pages remain separate; no new chain/model/browser
execution or submission is claimed.


The [CLI execution composition](../evidence/cli-observed-run-integration/README.md)
selects d437ad1 after all six original mandatory checks and full raw independent
review pass. The guide now runs the fixed observation through the CLI, with
admitted-plan binding, quota export and cancellation. All seven unchanged offline
reader scripts preserve their complete outcome facts; only selected CLI and its
exact source hash change. The coordinator table identifies the last audited
execution snapshot, not this new selector update's combined CI. New combined CI,
human main approval, Pages and formal submission remain separate. Frozen media,
model/holdouts, timed walkthroughs and the unsubmitted draft are unchanged.


The historical [account inspection composition](../evidence/account-impact-integration/README.md)
at root670e selected Engine88c6, SDKba4 and CLI6965 after each component's full
required CI/raw review. All five root670e checks and full raw review SHA6753979f
subsequently passed. At that checkpoint the selected viewera19 did not support
account wrappers; the new viewer composition below adds that display coupling.
The recorded13-input case retains all4 views and exact deltas, not profit or a
signed strategy. The prior CLI c04d baseline-unverified failure remains documented
with unknown cause; later passing CI does not establish that cause. Human main
approval, Pages and formal submission remain separate. Frozen model, holdout and
media sources stay unchanged.


The proposed [account viewer composition](../evidence/viewer-position-integration/README.md)
selects viewer4c6e after all four original mandatory checks and full raw independent
review pass. The ninth offline reader compares the original13 wrapper and nine
explicit synthetic controls with full SDK/Node classification, four typed/raw
phases, plan, three seals and nested trace facts. The earlier eight readers retain
all executable assertions; only the eighth's now-stale display-limit sentence is
updated. Historical facts remain unchanged except the selected viewer pin and
that scope text. Component browser verification remains separate from new combined
CI, human protected-main approval and live Pages. No new chain/model/user run.


The subsequent root2e05 SDK-to-browser composition passed all5 original checks
and full independent raw review6868f253. The next
[account summary composition](../evidence/account-summary-integration/README.md)
selects viewer8aa0 after all4 current mandatory checks and full original raw
reviewd54be9be. Its two exact changes precede the address and wide table, with
accessible mobile stacking and explicit null/no-debt/sign handling. Existing
nine reader bodies, complete recorded outputs and frozen sources remain exact
apart from the selected viewer pin. New combined rootCI and human protected-main
approval remain separate from component CI. Existing approved recordings retain
their original source versions; this new UI is not yet in those recordings.
No fresh chain/model/user evaluation, deployment or formal submission is claimed.
